# Automobile Sales Database
## Get Started
The project implements the semantics of a typical automobile company aiming to simplify the retrieval of sales data. One thing is worth to mention that all the data used here are completely imaginary. Here are the steps for you.
1. Set up a MySQL environment where you can run SQL files. It may be remote setup or locally installed in your machine from [MySQL Official Site](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
2. Firstly, to create the database run `initials.sql` file.
3. Then to implement the the relations run the following files in order `brands.sql`, `models.sql`, `suppliers.sql`, `vehicles.sql`, `dealers.sql`, `customers.sql` and `sales.sql`
## Queries
To check sample queries run the `queries.sql` file that shows a few insightful data regarding the context.
